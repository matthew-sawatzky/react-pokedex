# Pokedex Project

This project is a Pokedex application built with React, Redux, and TypeScript. It allows users to search for Pokemon, view their details, compare different Pokemon, and manage a list of favorite Pokemon. I made this project for my portfolio and don't have any intention of working on it further.

## Features

- **Search Pokemon**: Search for Pokemon by name and view their details.
- **Compare Pokemon**: Compare different Pokemon based on their stats and abilities.
- **Pokemon Details**: View detailed information about each Pokemon, including their evolution chain, locations, and capable moves.
- **Favorite List**: Manage a list of favorite Pokemon.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- **Redux Toolkit**: The official, recommended way to write Redux logic.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- **React Router**: A collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application.
- **SCSS**: A CSS preprocessor that adds power and elegance to the basic language.
